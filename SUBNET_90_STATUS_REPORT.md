# Subnet 90 ("Brain") Status Report
## DegenPredict Prediction Market Resolution

*Date: June 4, 2025*
*Current Status: OPERATIONAL BUT ZERO EMISSIONS*

---

## üìä Current State Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Subnet Exists**: Subnet 90 is live on Bittensor mainnet (finney)
- **You Are Owner**: Confirmed ownership (UID 0, coldkey: 5GbuKC)
- **Active Network**: 256 total neurons registered and active
- **Your Infrastructure**: Validator + 3 miners deployed on OVH KS-4 server
- **Technical Stack**: Complete codebase with Bittensor integration ready

### ‚ùå Critical Issue: Zero Emissions
```
Emission Rate: œÑ 0.0000
Root Network Allocation: 0%
Total TAO Available: œÑ 24.35 (subnet pool)
```

**Why Zero Emissions?**
Root network validators (netuid 0) have not allocated any weight to Subnet 90. Without root allocation, no TAO flows to your subnet regardless of internal activity.

## üöß Challenges & Blockers

### 1. Root Network Competition
- **Challenge**: 100+ subnets competing for limited root network allocation
- **Impact**: Zero emissions regardless of subnet performance
- **Root Cause**: New subnets typically start with 0% allocation

### 2. Economic Incentives Gap
- **Challenge**: No TAO rewards for validators/miners
- **Impact**: Difficult to attract external participants
- **Current State**: Running on your own hardware for business needs

### 3. Visibility & Recognition
- **Challenge**: Bittensor community unaware of subnet value
- **Impact**: Root validators don't know why to support Subnet 90
- **Current State**: No marketing or community engagement

## üîç Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Root Network Politics**: Allocation decisions may be subjective/political
- **Competition**: Many subnets competing for limited emissions
- **Technical Complexity**: Maintaining consensus quality at scale

### Medium Risk
- **Market Adoption**: Prediction markets may not need decentralized resolution
- **Cost Structure**: High TAO staking costs vs uncertain returns
- **Team Bandwidth**: Significant time investment required

### Low Risk
- **Technical Execution**: Core technology already proven
- **Infrastructure**: Reliable server and codebase foundation
- **Use Case**: Clear utility and business model

## üí° Recommendation

**Focus on Phase 1 immediately**: Launch production integration with DegenPredict and gather compelling performance data. This creates the foundation for all subsequent community and economic strategies.

**Success is achievable** because Subnet 90 has real utility, unlike many speculative subnets. The prediction market resolution use case is valuable, understandable, and measurable.

**Timeline**: With focused execution, root network allocation is realistic within 3-6 months, potentially generating $1k-10k monthly emissions at current TAO prices.

The key is proving value first, then building community support, then converting that into economic allocation. Your subnet has the technical foundation - now it needs market execution.
